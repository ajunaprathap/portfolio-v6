          <p>In today’s world cloud service is the most suitable option to store data online digitally. Currently there are multiple
           cloud storage apps available to users but most of these platforms have confusing task management solutions and cluttered dashboards.
           They lack simplicity and visibility when users try to create, organize and search for specific stored content.</p>
         <h2 class="process">Solution</h2>
          <p>Your Space aims to create a simple and intuitive user-friendly experience for users looking to create, upload, organize and share
           content with others. Users will not only have the ability to save any kind of content, all in one place but can also create their
           own content, organize their files and share it with others.</p>

                  <p>I started my research with a survey posted online to multiple media platforms, public forums and email contacts. I wanted to understand
                   what people were looking for in a cloud file-storage and sharing application. I also wanted to understand their frustrations and what they
                   currently use for storing information online.</p>

              <h2 class="process-steps">Competitive Analysis</h2>
                 <p>I then started to look at some of the top cloud services on the market today like Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive to study their
                 strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. I realized that all these products have their own pros and cons. Example, Dropbox
                 has a very simple and user friendly interface but the low visibility of file types on their dashboard is frustrating.
                 Similarly Google Drive has a very simple and intuitive design but there is no way to keep track of the files users have shared
                 in the past. In case of OneDrive, OneDrive has a very confusing file sharing process. These were all opportunities I saw for my product.
                 Apart from these, I also noticed that all three of them used similar iconography and also had blue as their primary color. So for my product I
                 decided to use a similar visual pattern so that my users could easily familiarise with my product.</p>

                 <p>My next step was to create low fidelity wireframes so that I could visualize all the abstract ideas and
                   concepts that had been outlined so far. Several iterations were made to the initial sketches to improve
                   the design. Once the sketches were finalized , I quickly converted them to digital wireframes and also
                   created a prototype that was used for the first round of usability testing.</p>
                   <h3>Test Result and Iterations</h3>
                   <p>1. When users were signing up for an account, they were quite confused to see a prefilled dashboard.
                     So to reduce this confusion I decided to provide an empty dasboard instead of a prefilled one.</p>
                     <img src="pictures/wireframe1.png" alt="Dashboard Iteration">
                  <p>2. For the task where users had to share a folder, most of the test participants found it difficult to
                    identify where the share icon was, so I decided to change the share icon to make it more visible.</p>

                     <p>After updating my design based on the results of the usability testing, I then proceeded to work on my branding.
                       For this I started by trying to come up with a suitable name for my product. After a lot of brainstorming I decided on the
                       name “Your Space” for my product because this name was very simple and easy to remember and it could immediately convey the
                       message to the users that the product was giving them “their own space” in cloud where they could backup their data and use it
                       any way they want.</p>

                     <p>Once I had decided on the name for my product, my next thought was about how I could display this name and how my logo was going to be.
                       For that I created several sketches which I continued to iterate until I finally decided on a logo which was perfect for my product.</p>

                   cloud storage service is to maintain, manage and backup users data, I wanted my brand to have a color that relates to my brand’s purpose.</p>

                   <p>Prior to updating my design based on the results of the preference test, I did the second round of usability testing.
                     I also had the design reviewd by my peers in the Thinkful community comprised of designers and developers across a variety
                     of experience levels.</p>
                     <h3>Feedback on Logo</h3>
                     <p>One important feedback I received was regarding my logo design. Users felt that my logo would look much
                     better without its black outline. Other feebacks that I received varied from things such as adjusting the size and shapes of buttons,
                     improving the clarity of icons,  as well as tweaking my design to give it a more trendy look.</p>
                  <img class="old-and-new-logos" src="pictures/initial_and_final_logo.png" alt="Initial and Final Logo">
                     <p>After spending several hours and days producing the reviewed design, the feedback was a breath of fresh air and resulted in my  “A HA” moments.
                       This process helped me understand the importance of constantly having another set of eyes review my work and receiving critique and feedback to
                       produce the best results.</p>

             <p>Overall, I feel that following the design process helped me stay very focused and also improved the efficiency of my work. </p>
             <p>My biggest challenge here was to come up with a suitable layout for my design. Laying out the content in a way that could display
               all the features in a neat and organized way, at the same time making sure the screens are not getting too cluttered was tricky.</p>
             <p>My second challenge was deciding on my brand color , logo and typefaces. Coming up with a suitable name and symbol that would not
                 only represent my brand but that would also relate to my brands purpose was a big challenge.</p>
             <p>The usability testing helped me realize that some of the features ( Eg: big size of add button, certain text representations, etc.,) that
                I had added in my design thinking it would make my design more user friendly, actually did not have the desired effect on real users.
                But instead several suggestions provided to me by my users actually helped me improve my design.</p>
