             <h3> Who am I ???</h3>
               <p>Hi! My name is Ajuna. I am a person who believes that learning how others think and applying parts of their process
                 to your own work is a great way to grow as a designer.</p>
             <h3> My Background...</h3>
               <p>My journey to design was not typical and my career didn't begin in UX.  I graduated in Biotechnology, worked for a couple
                  of years in Health Care and have also volunteered at several non profit organizations. While these
                  experiences run the gamut of industries, the common thread that ties them together is my passion to help people and understand
                  their needs.</p>
            <h3> Important Decisions...</h3>
              <p>While I found great value in the work I was doing, I still felt that this was not the career I envisioned for myself. I wanted to
                 do something more creative that involved critical thinking as well as helping others. I started researching about different jobs available
                 in the market, I talked to working professionals from various backgrounds to get exposure to different jobs. I asked them what their job exactly
                 entailed and tried to imagine myself living their life. After talking to multiple designers and reading extensively on what UX is, I was convinced
                 that this was the field I wanted to break into.</p>
            <h3> Taking a Leap...</h3>
              <p>I started by first taking few online classes on Web Designing and Development, but making a career change takes serious commitment. So I decided to
                 join a UX Design Bootcamp. This program integrated on all aspects of UI/UX Design and the foundation of Frontend Development. During my mentorship program,
                 I learned how to craft user survey and evaluate user research, create wireframes and user flows, write user stories, do user testing and iteration,
                 and prototyping. This program helped me understand what it meant to be a problem solver and how to refocus the different skills and talents I had previously
                 accrued over the years into a process that produces user centered products.</p>
            <h3> Now...</h3>
             <p>I am currently pursuing a full time position in the field of UI/UX. I bring with me a natural tendancy for empathy, as well as a passionate need to create
               effortless experiences. I’m on a journey to become the best at what I do. Along the way, I hope to work with amazing people and build invaluable experiences.</p>
