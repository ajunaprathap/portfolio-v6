                <p><span style="font-size:1rem;font-weight:bold">One</span> -  I love to cook! I could spend hours and
                             hours in the kitchen trying out new recipes
                          without getting exausted.

                <p><span style="font-size:1rem;font-weight:bold">Three</span> - I enjoy doing canvas and glass paintings. I think
                            I inherited that interest from my dad.</p>

                 <h3>My background.....</h3>

                      <p>My journey to design was not typical and my career didn't begin in UX.  I graduated in Biotechnology, worked for a couple of years
                        in the Health Care Industry and have also volunteered at several non profit organizations. While these experiences run the gamut of
                        industries the common thread that ties them together is my passion to help people and understand their needs. While I found great value
                        in the work I was doing, I still felt that this was not the career I envisioned for myself. I wanted to do something more creative that
                        involved critical thinking as well as helping others. It was then that I realized that Design has always been my passion.
                        After talking to multiple designers and reading extensively on what UX is, I was convinced that this was the field I wanted to break into.</p>

                 <h3>Taking a Leap....</h3>

                    <p>The online web design and development calsses as well as the UX Design Bootcamp helped me understand what it meant to be a problem solver
                      and how to refocus the different skills and talents I had previously accrued over the years into a process that produces user centered products.</p>

                  <h3>Now....</h3>

                    <p>I am currently pursuing a full time position in the field of UI/UX. I bring with me a natural tendancy for empathy, as well as a passionate
                      need to create effortless experiences. I’m on a journey to become the best at what I do. Along the way, I hope to work with amazing people and
                      build invaluable experiences.</p>
