          <p>In today’s world cloud service is the most suitable option to store data online digitally. Currently there are multiple
           cloud storage apps available to users but most of these platforms have confusing task management solutions and cluttered dashboards.
           They lack simplicity and visibility when users try to create, organize and search for specific stored content.</p>
         <h2 class="process center-align">Solution</h2>
          <p>Your Space aims to create a simple and intuitive user-friendly experience for users looking to create, upload, organize and share
           content with others. Users will not only have the ability to save any kind of content, all in one place but can also create their
           own content, organize their files and share it with others.</p>

                    <p>I started my research with a survey posted online to multiple media platforms, public forums and email contacts. I wanted to understand
                     what people were looking for in a cloud file-storage and sharing application. I also wanted to understand their frustrations and what they
                     currently use for storing information online.</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-heading">By analysing the results of my user survey I understood that:</h3>

                      <p class="add-padding-top-survey">When asked what they disliked the most about the current tools, majority of the user survey participants responded that the issue they faced the most was
                        trying to keep all their files and work organized. They also found it difficult to access stored content easily.</p>

                     were. So based on this I created two user personas.</p>

                   <p>I then started to look at some of the top cloud services on the market today like Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive. Studying their
                   strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats helped me realized that all these products have their own pros and cons. I also noticed that
                   all three of them used similar iconography and also used blue as their primary color. So for my product I
                   decided to use a similar visual pattern so that my users could easily familiarise with my product.</p>

                   created a prototype that was used for the first round of usability testing.</p>
                   <h3 class="center-align add-margin">Test Result and Iterations</h3>
                   <p>1. When users were signing up for an account, they were quite confused to see a prefilled dashboard.
                     So to reduce this confusion I decided to provide an empty dasboard instead of a prefilled one.</p>

               <p class="paragraph-holder paragraph-holder-center">After spending several hours and days producing the reviewed design, the feedback was a breath of fresh air and resulted in my  “A HA” moments.
                 This process helped me understand the importance of constantly having another set of eyes review my work and receiving critique and feedback to
                 produce the best results.</p>

             <p>Overall, I feel that following the design process helped me stay very focused and also improved the efficiency of my work. </p>
             <p>My biggest challenge here was to come up with a suitable layout for my design. Laying out the content in a way that could display
               all the features in a neat and organized way, at the same time making sure the screens are not getting too cluttered was tricky.</p>
             <p>My second challenge was deciding on my brand color , logo and typefaces. Coming up with a suitable name and symbol that would not
                 only represent my brand but that would also relate to my brands purpose was a big challenge.</p>
             <p>The usability testing helped me realize that some of the features ( Eg: big size of add button, certain text representations, etc.,) that
                I had added in my design thinking it would make my design more user friendly, actually did not have the desired effect on real users.
                But instead several suggestions provided to me by my users actually helped me improve my design.</p>
